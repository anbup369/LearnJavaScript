API Response Status Code Validator

As an SDET, you receive an API response status code and need to classify it. Write a JavaScript program using a switch statement that takes an HTTP status code stored in a variable and prints the category and a QA-friendly message.

- 200 → "PASS - OK: Request successful"
- 201 → "PASS - Created: Resource created successfully"
- 301 → "WARNING - Moved Permanently: URL has changed"
- 400 → "FAIL - Bad Request: Check request payload"
- 401 → "FAIL - Unauthorized: Check auth token"
- 403 → "FAIL - Forbidden: Insufficient permissions"
- 404 → "FAIL - Not Found: Check endpoint URL"
- 500 → "FAIL - Internal Server Error: Backend issue"
- Any other → "UNKNOWN - Unhandled status code"

Examples:

Input:
statusCode = 401

Output:
Status Code : 401 Result : FAIL - Unauthorized: Check auth token

💡 Explanation:The switch matches case 401 and outputs the corresponding FAIL message for unauthorized requests.
